# TASKS.md — Active Task Board

> **This is the single source of truth for what needs to be done.**
> Agents: Pick up tasks from here. Update status when you start/finish.
> Coordinator: Add new tasks here. Agents should check this file at the start of every session.

## How to Use
- **Claiming a task:** Change status to `IN PROGRESS` and add your agent name (e.g., `Claude 1`)
- **Completing a task:** Change status to `DONE`, add completion notes, and log details in PROGRESS.md
- **Blocked?** Mark as `BLOCKED`, note why, and move on to something else
- **New work discovered?** Add it to the Backlog section and tag the coordinator

## Backlog (P3)

### Task 13 frontend — Genie chat UI on dashboard page
- **Owner:** Claude 1
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** P3
- **Completed:** 2026-02-22
- **Details:**
  - Created `GenieChat.jsx` component with input, starter questions, loading state, answer + data table + SQL viewer + follow-up suggestions
  - Added `askGenie()` to `api.js`, integrated into `DashboardPage.jsx`
  - Verified: build passes, backend endpoint live on production
- **Acceptance criteria:** Users can ask natural language questions and see Genie answers on /dashboard ✅

### Task 16 — Enhanced map: neighborhood boundaries + surrounding states
- **Owner:** Claude 1
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** P3
- **Completed:** 2026-02-22
- **Details:**
  - Rewrote `NYCMap.jsx` with 3-layer architecture: surrounding states (bottom) → 197 NTA neighborhood polygons (middle) → borough outlines (top)
  - Created `neighborhoodToNtaMap.js` mapping 60 curated names → NTA GeoJSON feature names
  - Created `surrounding_states.geojson` (NY, NJ, CT, PA, MA — 110KB, Census 500k resolution)
  - Lava gradient for neighborhoods, muted navy for states, two-row legend
  - Dynamic style updates via ref+setStyle (no flicker on poll refresh)
  - `minZoom={7}` allows zooming out to see tri-state area
- **Acceptance criteria:** 197 neighborhood polygons colored by density, borough outlines visible, surrounding states visible when zoomed out, legend updated ✅

### Topic-colored choropleth on map
- **Owner:** TBD
- **Status:** ROADMAP
- **Priority:** P3
- **Details:** Color the NYC map by dominant topic per borough instead of just registration density. Depends on NLP pipeline (Task 12, done) populating `registration_topics`.

### Teardown script
- Clean up all infrastructure after the event
- Low priority — do after demo
